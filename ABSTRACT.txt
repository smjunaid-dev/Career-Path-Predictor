ABSTRACT:
The Career Path Predictor using Machine Learning is an AI-based system that helps students identify suitable career options based on their interests, academic scores, and skill sets. The project leverages a classification algorithm to analyze the user's input data and predict a matching career domain such as Software Developer, Data Analyst, Designer, or Manager.

A dataset containing mock student profiles and corresponding career paths is used to train the model. The model is trained and tested using Python and can be integrated into a simple web interface for user interaction. Optionally, the system can be deployed using Microsoft Azure ML Studio or Azure App Service for cloud accessibility.

This project aims to demonstrate how AI can assist in educational guidance and decision-making through predictive analytics.
